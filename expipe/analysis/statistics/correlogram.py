def correlogram(t1, t2=None, bin_width=.001, limit=.02, auto=False):
    """Return crosscorrelogram of two spike trains.
    
    Essentially, this algorithm subtracts each spike time in `t1` 
    from all of `t2` and bins the results with np.histogram, though
    several tweaks were made for efficiency.
    
    Arguments
    ---------
        t1 : first spiketrain, raw spike times in seconds.
        t2 : second spiketrain, raw spike times in seconds.
        bin_width : width of each bar in histogram in sec
        limit : positive and negative extent of histogram, in seconds
        auto : if True, then returns autocorrelogram of `t1` and in
            this case `t2` can be None.
    
    Returns
    -------
        (count, bins) : a tuple containing the bin edges (in seconds) and the
        count of spikes in each bin.

        `bins` is relative to `t1`. That is, if `t1` leads `t2`, then
        `count` will peak in a positive time bin.
