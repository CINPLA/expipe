# Expipe

Expipe is a lightweight data analysis platform that aims to simplify the steps
from experiment to data analysis.
We acknowledge the need for multiple tools, workflows and formats in
experimental pipelines and have made an agnostic platform that focuses on adding
value and formalizing existing workflows rather than a one-size-fits all
solution.
Expipe provides functionality to track experimental data and metadata for easy
retrieval in exploration and analysis.
The goal of Expipe is to simplify data management and allow the user to focus on
production and analysis of the data.

## Installation

See the [documentation](http://cinpla.github.io/expipe)
