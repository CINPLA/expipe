Welcome to Expipe's documentation!
==========================================

Expipe is a lightweight data management platform that aims to simplify the steps
from experiment to data analysis. We acknowledge the need for multiple tools,
workflows and formats in experimental pipelines and have made an agnostic
platform that focuses on adding value and formalizing existing workflows
rather than a one-size-fits all solution. Expipe provides functionality to
track experimental data and metadata for easy retrieval in exploration and
analysis. The goal of Expipe is to simplify data management and allow the user
to focus on production and analysis of the data.
